                <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you,</h1>
                <p> 
                    I'm Isabella. 
                    I am a first-year student at the University of British Columbia
                    who is working towards a double major in computer science and creative writing.
                    I am very excited to be working towards a career in video game writing and design.
                    Writing and programming have been passions of mine for a very long time.
                    I started pursuing game design in elementary school,
                    when I realized that I could get a job making the video games that I loved playing.
                    In my free time, I teach coding at UTG Academy and work on various game projects.
                    I love working with a team; and in the future, I look forward to working
                    with others who are as excited about their field as I am.
